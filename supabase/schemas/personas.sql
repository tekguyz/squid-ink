-- personas: one row per lens a user can read a note through.
--
-- Was a hardcoded array in lib/notes/persona-presets.ts. Three of the four
-- personas had no backing row at all, so a takeaway could not be attributed
-- to a lens (docs/KNOWN_GAPS.md). This table plus note_chunks.persona_id is
-- what closes that.
--
-- slug, not id, is what the view model exposes as Persona.id. The client
-- remembers "neutral-analyst" across users and reseeds; a per-user uuid
-- would not survive either.
--
-- depth is ROADMAP.md §5's Brief/Dense/Exhaustive. Nothing consumes it yet —
-- there is no model routing and no UI control — but it is a property of a
-- persona, so it lives here rather than being invented later on a chunk.
--
-- Every statement is idempotent so the whole file can be re-applied.
