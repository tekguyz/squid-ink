# Known Gaps

## Missing design-reference files (recorded 2026-08-30)

The brief named three files to read. Only one was present.

| Named | Actual | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `Note_Detail_dc.html` | `Note Detail.dc.html` | Present, filename differs |
| `App_Surfaces_dc.html` | — | Missing |
| `support.js` | — | Missing |

Impact: none on this build. `Note Detail.dc.html` turn 3 contains the full
layout, the locked token spec (3c), the mock data, and the citation-click
behavior. `App_Surfaces_dc.html` was reference-only for shared-component
patterns; `support.js` was explicitly not to be shipped. Nothing was guessed at.

Open: shared badge/button/nav conventions from App Surfaces are unverified.
Revisit before building a second surface.

## State management — Zustand not used here (recorded 2026-08-30)

Zustand not invoked here — state is local to one component, no drawers/cross-route
state in this build. Revisit if a second stateful surface needs to share state.

This is a divergence from the locked DECISIONS.md choice of Zustand for ephemeral
client UI state. `note-detail-shell.tsx` uses plain `useState` for the three pieces
of state (active segment, selected persona, composer draft). Recorded, not silent.

Note: no `DECISIONS.md` file was found on disk under `C:/Projects` at the time of
writing, so this divergence is recorded from the stated decision rather than from
a checked-in file.

## Tokens not enumerated in 3c (recorded 2026-08-30)

3c is the locked token spec, but the 3a/3b markup uses more steps than 3c lists.
Every value below is lifted **verbatim** from the 3a/3b markup or the design
file's own component data block — none is invented or interpolated — and each
sits inside a range 3c declares ("hue 80–88 for text", "Espresso — hue 46–50,
chroma 0.012–0.016", "Newsprint — hue 80–84, chroma 0.010–0.023").

Not in 3c:

- `--speaker-1/2/3` and their `-avatar` pairs — the three per-speaker tones
  (blue / green / amber). Source: the `tones` map in the design file's component
  script, not the token card.
- `--rule-3` (`oklch(0.898 0.019 82)` light, `oklch(0.27 0.015 48)` dark) — the
  lighter hairline used between action-item rows.
- `--rail`, `--pane`, `--dock` **dark** values — 3c lists four Espresso surfaces;
  3b uses three more (`0.155 0.013 46`, `0.215 0.015 50`, `0.165 0.013 48`).
- `--tint-hover` dark (`oklch(0.42 0.09 140)`) and `--seg-wash` dark
  (`oklch(0.26 0.045 140)`).
- The dark grey text steps `--meta`, `--meta-2`, `--meta-3`, `--meta-4`,
  `--meta-5`, `--muted`, `--faint`, `--placeholder`, `--rail-idle`, `--notice`.
  3c gives one dark ink value and a hue range; 3b uses ten steps within it.

Impact: low, but these are the values most likely to drift if a second surface is
built from 3c alone. If App Surfaces is ever supplied, reconcile against it.

## Additions and decisions outside the design (recorded 2026-08-30)

- **Theme toggle** (`components/theme-toggle.tsx`) is not in the design file.
  Added at the user's request so both token sets can be checked without changing
  the OS setting. Fixed bottom-right, follows `prefers-color-scheme` until first
  use, then persists to `localStorage`.
- **Fluid layout.** The design is a fixed 1348x884 artboard. At the user's
  direction the page is full-viewport-height with the rail pinned at 136px and
  the transcript pane at 404px; the middle pane flexes. Pixel-faithful at 1348px
  wide. Below roughly 1100px the three columns get cramped — no responsive
  breakpoint was in scope for this build.
- **Citation chips are `<button>`, not `<span>`.** The design draws a span.
  A span is not keyboard-reachable and gives a screen reader no affordance, so
  the chip ships as a real button with `aria-pressed` and an accessible name
  ("Jump to transcript at 04:12"). Visual result is identical.
- **Speaker labels are always on.** The design has a `showSpeakerLabels` prop and
  a "labels unavailable" notice for recordings without diarisation. The notice is
  built and styled in `transcript-pane.tsx`, but nothing toggles it yet — it needs
  real transcription data, which is out of scope here.
- **TypeScript 7.0.2** was pinned and typechecked clean. No fallback to 6.x was
  needed.

## Not built (out of scope for this build)

The other eight App Surfaces screens, Supabase/auth/any backend, real
transcription or RAG data, PWA setup, brand assets, and routing beyond
`/notes/[id]`. The composer accepts and clears input but sends nothing.

## Code-review findings not acted on (recorded 2026-08-30)

Reviewed against `web-design-guidelines` and `vercel-react-best-practices`.
Six findings were fixed (native `color-scheme` per theme, action-item label hit
target, `autocomplete`/`enterkeyhint` on the ask input, `text-pretty` on the
title, memoised waveform, theme-toggle first-paint label). Two were considered
and deliberately left:

- **State is not deep-linked.** The web guidelines ask that stateful UI —
  selected lens, expanded panels — live in the URL so it can be shared and
  restored. Selected persona and active transcript segment are `useState` only.
  Deferred because the plan pinned local state for this single screen; see the
  Zustand entry above. Worth revisiting together with that decision, not
  separately.
- **The transcript SEARCH control is inert.** It is drawn in the design and
  built here as a real focusable button, but has no handler — searching the
  transcript was not in scope. It should either be wired or removed before this
  screen ships to a user.
